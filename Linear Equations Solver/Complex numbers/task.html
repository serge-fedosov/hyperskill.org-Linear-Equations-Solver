<h5 id="description">Description</h5>

<p>In this stage, you should implement the ability to work with complex numbers. A set of complex numbers is wider than a set of real numbers. You can look <a target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" target="_blank" href="https://www.mathsisfun.com/numbers/complex-numbers.html" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">here</a> to see how to implement addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with complex numbers.</p>

<p>You can read a complex number in the following way: a double number, then a plus or a minus, then another double number, and then the symbol <code class="java">i</code>. If there is no plus or minus, then the number has the imaginary part equal to zero. If there is no plus or minus but the number ends with <code class="java">i</code>, then the number has the real part equal to zero. Also, if there is <code class="java">1</code> before <span style="color: #000000;"><span style="background-color: #f3f4f6; font-size: 14.399999618530273px;">i</span></span>,  like in <code class="java">2+1i</code> or <code class="java">-1i</code>, then <code class="java">1</code> can be omitted, like in <code class="java">2+i</code> and <code class="java">-i</code>.</p>

<p>Remember that you should write to file either <code class="java">No solutions</code>, or <code class="java">Infinitely many solutions</code>, or the solution. Every variable of the solution should be on a separate line and shouldn't contain any spaces (real part, plus/minus, imaginary part).</p>

<p>If the real part of a number is equal to zero, you should write only the imaginary part, and in case the imaginary part also equals zero, then you should simply write <code class="java">0</code>. Also, if the imaginary part is equal to zero, then write only the real part. If the imaginary part is equal to <code class="java">1</code>, write <code class="java">i</code> instead of <code class="java">1i</code>, like in the parsing examples above.</p>

<h5 id="example">Example</h5>

<p>Suppose you have a file named <code class="java">in.txt</code>, which contains the following (note that the first line contains the number of rows and the number of columns):</p>

<pre><code class="java">3 3
1+2i -1.5-1.1i 2.12 91+5i
-1+3i 1.2+3.5i -3.3 1+15i
12.31 1.3-5i 12.3i -78.3i</code></pre>

<p>Below is how your program might work. The lines which start with <code class="java">&gt;</code> represent the user input.</p>

<pre><code class="java">&gt; java Solver -in in.txt -out out.txt
Start solving the equation.
Rows manipulation:
R1 / 1+2i -&gt; R1
1-3i * R1 + R2 -&gt; R2
-12.31 * R1 + R3 -&gt; R3
R2 / 1.6+6.1i -&gt; R2
-10.40+9.67i * R2 + R3 -&gt; R3
R3 / -6.78+9.71i -&gt; R3
0.54-0.74i * R3 + R2 -&gt; R2
-0.42+0.84i * R3 + R1 -&gt; R1
0.74-0.38i * R2 + R1 -&gt; R1
The solution is: (6.73-22.99i, -1.79+2.0i, 15.6994+7.396i)
Saved to file out.txt</code></pre>

<p> And the file <code class="java">out.txt</code> should look like this:  </p>

<pre><code class="language-no-highlight">6.73-22.99i
-1.79+2.0i
15.6994+7.396i</code></pre>
